# PptGenerator Sample Script
# by CXuesong, 2015

# Basic Contracts
# Each line (not starting with #) represents an instruction.
# Seperate operation name and its parameters with a single tab char.
# Operation name is case-insensitive.
# If you'd like to fill a parameter with its default value, please leave nothing between two tabs.
# The left indension of each line (currently determined by the count of blank characters) decides the closure of current operation.
# Empty or whitespaced line is ignored.
# Comment lines begin with #. (Though they can have indension.)
# As for a list of all available operations and their parameters, please refer to Closures.cs and look up all the methods with [ClosureOperationAttribute] .

# Currently, if Debug is set to True, the path of the image will be shown on each slide.
Debug	True

# Switch work path, which determines the default path of image files.
